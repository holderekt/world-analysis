This project consists in:

- Domain analysis
- Statistical analysis
    - Missing data removal and inference
    - Outlier removal
- Clustering
    - Multidimensional KMeans
    - Agglomerative
    - DBSCAN 
    - KMeans and Agglomerative on Haar wavelet transform
    - KMeans and Agglomerative on Dinamic Time Warping data
- Pattern mining
    - Apriori on cluster data
